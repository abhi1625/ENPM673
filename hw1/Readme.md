##ENPM-673 Homework-1 

#### Code Structure:
The code for the homework is divided into three parts:

[] `hw1p1.py` Code for Geometric interpretation of eigen values for data1, data2 and data3
[] `hw1p2.py` Code for line fitting using least squares with vertical and orthogonal distance methods
[] `hw1p3.py` Code for outlier rejection methods: least squares method with regularization and RANSAC  

#### Running the code:

To run each file just write `python hw1p1.py`
